                <p>A cancer diagnosis is upsetting at any age, but especially so when the patient is a child. It's
                    natural to have many questions, such as, Who should treat my child? Will my child get well? What
                    does all of this mean for our family? Not all questions have answers, but the information and
                    resources on this page provide a starting point for understanding the basics of childhood cancer.

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <div class="paratreat">
                There are many types of cancer treatment. The types of treatment that a child with cancer receives will
                depend on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. Common treatments include: surgery, chemotherapy,
                radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and stem cell transplant. <br> <br>
                Before any new treatment can be made widely available to patients, it must be studied in clinical trials
                (research studies) and found to be safe and effective in treating disease. Clinical trials for children
                and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to compare potentially better therapy with therapy
                that is currently accepted as standard. Most of the progress made in identifying curative therapies for
                childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.

            <h3>Causes</h3>
            <div class="paracause">
                <p>Parents of children with cancer can sometimes feel like something they did, or didn’t do, caused
                    their child’s cancer. We don’t know what causes, or how to prevent most childhood cancers and no one
                    should feel blamed. <br> <br>

                    Although we have identified a number of lifestyle changes that can help to reduce the risk of adults
                    developing cancer. It doesn’t look like there is anything we can do to prevent most childhood
                    cancers. <br><br>

                    Cancer is not infectious. You can’t catch it from another person and your child can’t pass it on to
                    their siblings or other children in their school. It is unlikely for 2 children in one family to get
                    diagnosed with childhood cancer. <br><br>
